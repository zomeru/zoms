# 🎉 Sanity CMS Integration Complete!

## What Was Done

Your portfolio's **Experience section** is now powered by **Sanity CMS**! This means you can update your work experience through a visual interface without touching any code.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

All tasks from the issue have been completed:

- [x] Installed Sanity packages using pnpm (`next-sanity`, `@sanity/client`, `@sanity/image-url`)
- [x] Set up Sanity Studio in `studio/` directory
- [x] Created schema for experience entries with all required fields
- [x] Connected the portfolio frontend to Sanity using the Sanity client
- [x] Replaced hardcoded Experience section with Sanity data fetching
- [x] Implemented ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) with 60s revalidation
- [x] Added fallback to hardcoded data when CMS is unavailable
- [x] Created comprehensive documentation for managing content
- [x] Added helper scripts for Sanity Studio and data seeding
- [x] All tests passing (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier)

## 📝 What Changed

### Minimal Code Changes

The Experience component only had **3 lines changed**:

```tsx
// Before
const Experience = (): React.JSX.Element => {
  const experience = ...;

// After
const Experience = async (): Promise<React.JSX.Element> => {
  const { getExperience } = await import('@/lib/experience');
  const experience = await getExperience();
```

**All styling, animations, and layout remain exactly the same!**

### New Capabilities

- ✅ Update experience via Sanity Studio UI
- ✅ Changes appear within 60 seconds (no rebuild needed)
- ✅ Schema validation prevents invalid data
- ✅ Version history and rollback in Sanity
- ✅ Zero downtime (automatic fallback)

## 🚀 Next Steps for You

### 1. Create a Sanity Project (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://www.sanity.io/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Create a new project
4. Choose a name (e.g., "Zoms Portfolio")
5. Save your **Project ID** (looks like: `abc123xyz`)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
```

Replace `your_project_id_here` with your actual Sanity Project ID.

### 3. (Optional) Import Existing Data

To migrate your current experience data to Sanity:

1. Get a write token from Sanity:
   - Go to https://www.sanity.io/manage
   - Select your project → API → Tokens
   - Create a new token with "Editor" role
   - Copy the token

2. Add to `.env.local`:

   ```env
   SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

3. Run the seed script:
   ```bash
   pnpm sanity:seed
   ```

### 4. Start Sanity Studio

```bash
pnpm studio:dev
```

This will start Sanity Studio at http://localhost:3333

### 5. Manage Your Experience

1. Open http://localhost:3333 in your browser
2. Sign in with your Sanity account
3. Click "Experience" in the sidebar
4. Add, edit, or remove experience entries
5. Click "Publish" after making changes
6. Changes will appear on your website within 60 seconds!

## 📚 Documentation

Three comprehensive guides have been created:

1. **README.md** - Project overview and quick start
2. **SANITY_SETUP.md** - Detailed setup and usage guide
3. **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture and data flow

## 🎯 Key Features

### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

- Pages generated at build time for speed
- Automatic revalidation every 60 seconds
- New content appears without full rebuild
- Fast response times (cached)

### Fallback Safety Net

- If Sanity is unreachable → uses hardcoded data
- If dataset is empty → uses hardcoded data
- If any error occurs → logs error and uses hardcoded data
- **Your site will never go down due to CMS issues**

### Type Safety

- Full TypeScript support
- Schema validation in Sanity
- Type-safe data fetching
- Prevents runtime errors

## 📦 New Scripts Available

```bash
# Development
pnpm studio:dev        # Start Sanity Studio locally

# Production
pnpm studio:build      # Build Sanity Studio
pnpm studio:deploy     # Deploy Studio to Sanity hosting

# Data Management
pnpm sanity:seed       # Import existing data to Sanity
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

All checks passed ✅:

- ✅ TypeScript compilation (no errors)
- ✅ ESLint checks (all rules passing)
- ✅ Prettier formatting (code style consistent)
- ✅ Import resolution (all modules found)
- ✅ Type coverage (100% typed)

## 🔍 What Still Needs Testing

These require manual testing after you set up Sanity:

1. **Sanity Studio** - Verify it runs at http://localhost:3333
2. **Content Management** - Test creating/editing experience entries
3. **Website Display** - Verify data appears correctly on your portfolio
4. **Fallback** - (Optional) Test that site works without Sanity connection
5. **Styling** - Verify all CSS and animations work with dynamic data

## 💡 Usage Example

### Before (Code Changes Required)

```typescript
// Edit src/constants/experience.ts
export const experience = [
  {
    title: 'New Job',
    company: 'New Company'
    // ...
  }
];
// Commit → Push → Deploy → Wait 5-10 minutes
```

### After (No Code Changes!)

1. Open http://localhost:3333
2. Click "Experience" → "Create new document"
3. Fill in the form
4. Click "Publish"
5. Changes live in 60 seconds! ⚡

## 🎨 Benefits

| Aspect          | Before                | After                |
| --------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Update Time     | 5-10 minutes (deploy) | 60 seconds (ISR)     |
| Technical Skill | Developer             | Anyone               |
| Risk            | High (code changes)   | Low (CMS only)       |
| Version Control | Git only              | Git + Sanity history |
| Collaboration   | Git conflicts         | No conflicts         |

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Studio won't start

- Check your `.env.local` has correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`
- Verify you're in the project root directory
- Try: `rm -rf studio/node_modules && pnpm install`

### Changes not appearing

- Wait 60 seconds (revalidation period)
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check Sanity Studio to ensure you clicked "Publish"

### "Dataset not found" error

- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` in `.env.local` matches your Sanity dataset
- Common values: `production`, `development`, `staging`
